# A Kikuyu ASR Project

## Introduction
The Kikuyu ASR Project is an initiative to develop an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for the Kikuyu language, a low-resource language spoken in Kenya. This ASR system aims to accurately transcribe spoken Kikuyu into text, making it accessible, searchable, and useful for various applications.

## Project Goals
- **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse and representative dataset of spoken Kikuyu language samples.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and augment the collected data to create a suitable training dataset.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant audio features for effective representation of speech signals.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with different ML models to identify the best architecture for Kikuyu ASR.
- **Training and Optimization**: Train and optimize the selected model(s) for accurate transcription.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the ASR system's performance using relevant metrics.
- **Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly interface for accessibility.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implement feedback mechanisms for ongoing improvement.
